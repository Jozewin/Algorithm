what is StableSort?
    lets take a array with duplication and see

    1) 90 43 23 2 5 2 ==> 2 2 5 23 43 90

    here we can see a array with duplication
    In a array sorting arent problem which number comes first doesn't matter

    Lets see with a another question

    2)Trains shedules

    // Unsorted             // Time alone sorted
    time and city               time and city
    10 tuty                      1 Theni
    5 coimbatore                 2 Chennai
    2 chennai           ==>      5 Coimbatore
    1 Theni                     10 Tuty
    12 Chennai                  12 Chennai


    // Again now Sorting by alphabets

    12  Chennai
     2  Chennai
     5  Coimbatore
     1  Theni
    10  Tuty

    In the above sorted table we can see that the order has changed
    the 2'O clock chennai train should have came 1st
    But instead of that the 12'O clock chennai train came 1st

    This sorting is called UnstableSort

    Stablesort cant be achieved by SelectionSort
    but can be by other sorts
